  dialogueList:
  - I'm getting old, and I can't remember many things.
  - Who are you? Never mind, I don't care who you are. Can you help me find the mailbox
    key?
  - The old man said he would send me a ticket soon and asked me to go out with him.
    Although I'm not really interested...
  - He has been tinkering his whole life, either fiddling with a time machine upstairs
    or going out to sea to find something.
  - These strange TV programs are really not interesting.
  - The old man says there are many secrets on this island, but I know he's just
    trying to find something to do because life on the island is too lonely.
  - People, well, who hasn't been young? When I was young... never mind, let's not
    talk about the past.
  - It's only when you get old that you realize everything is quietly mysterious.
